@article{Elvidge2023,
	abstract = {Abstract Multi-model ensembles (MMEs) are used to improve the forecasts of thermospheric neutral densities. A variety of algorithms for constructing the model weights for the MMEs are described and have been implemented including: performance weighting, independence weighting, and non-negative least squares. Using both empirical and physics-based models, compared against in situ Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) observations, the skill of each MME weighting approach has been tested in both solar minimum and maximum conditions. In both cases the MME performs better than any individual model. A non-negative least squares weighting for the MME on a set of bias corrected models provides a 68\% and 50\% reduction in the mean square error compared to the best model (Jacchia-Bowman 2008) in the solar minimum and maximum cases, respectively.},

@article{Doblas-Reyes2003,
	abstract = {The skill assessment of a set of wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) seasonal predictions in a multi-model ensemble framework has been carried out. The multi-model approach consists in merging the ensemble hindcasts of four atmospheric general circulation models forced with observed sea surface temperatures to create a multi-model ensemble. Deterministic (ensemble-mean based) and probabilistic (categorical) NAO hindcasts have been considered. Two different sets of NAO indices have been used to create the hindcasts. A first set is defined as the projection of model anomalies onto the NAO spatial pattern obtained from atmospheric analyses. The second set obtains the NAO indices by standardizing the leading principal component of each single-model ensemble. Positive skill is found with both sets of indices, especially in the case of the multi-model ensemble. In addition, the NAO definition based upon the single-model leading principal component shows a higher skill than the hindcasts obtained using the projection method. Using the former definition, the multi-model ensemble shows statistically significant (at 5{\%} level) positive skill in a variety of probabilistic scoring measures. This is interpreted as a consequence of the projection method being less suitable because of the presence of errors in the spatial NAO patterns of the models. The positive skill of the seasonal NAO found here seems to be due not to the persistence of the long-term (decadal) variability specified in the initial conditions, but rather to a good simulation of the year-to-year variability. Nevertheless, most of the NAO seasonal predictability seems to be due to the correct prediction of particular cases such as the winter of 1989. The higher skill of the multi-model has been explained on the basis of a more reliable description of large-scale tropospheric wave features by the multi-model ensemble, illustrating the potential of multi-model experiments to better identify mechanisms that explain seasonal variability in the atmosphere.},

@article{Tebaldi2007,
	abstract = { Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multi-model ensembles sample initial condition, parameter as well as structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantify uncertainty in future climate in a probabilistic way. This paper outlines the motivation for using multi-model ensembles, reviews the methodologies published so far and compares their results for regional temperature projections. The challenges in interpreting multi-model results, caused by the lack of verification of climate projections, the problem of model dependence, bias and tuning as well as the difficulty in making sense of an `ensemble of opportunity', are discussed in detail. },

@article{Ribes2021,
	abstract = {Historical temperature record narrows uncertainty on past and future human-induced warming leading to refined climate projections. Many studies have sought to constrain climate projections based on recent observations. Until recently, these constraints had limited impact, and projected warming ranges were driven primarily by model outputs. Here, we use the newest climate model ensemble, improved observations, and a new statistical method to narrow uncertainty on estimates of past and future human-induced warming. Cross-validation suggests that our method produces robust results and is not overconfident. We derive consistent observationally constrained estimates of attributable warming to date and warming rate, the response to a range of future scenarios, and metrics of climate sensitivity. We find that historical observations narrow uncertainty on projected future warming by about 50\%. Our results suggest that using an unconstrained multimodel ensemble is no longer the best choice for global mean temperature projections and that the lower end of previous estimates of 21st century warming can now be excluded.},

@article{Knutti2017,
	abstract = {Abstract Uncertainties of climate projections are routinely assessed by considering simulations from different models. Observations are used to evaluate models, yet there is a debate about whether and how to explicitly weight model projections by agreement with observations. Here we present a straightforward weighting scheme that accounts both for the large differences in model performance and for model interdependencies, and we test reliability in a perfect model setup. We provide weighted multimodel projections of Arctic sea ice and temperature as a case study to demonstrate that, for some questions at least, it is meaningless to treat all models equally. The constrained ensemble shows reduced spread and a more rapid sea ice decline than the unweighted ensemble. We argue that the growing number of models with different characteristics and considerable interdependence finally justifies abandoning strict model democracy, and we provide guidance on when and how this can be achieved robustly.},

@article{Millington2011,
	abstract = {Abstract Multi-model inference (MMI) aims to contribute to the production of scientific knowledge by simultaneously comparing the evidence data provide for multiple hypotheses, each represented as a model. With roots in the method of `multiple working hypotheses', MMI techniques have been advocated as an alternative to null-hypothesis significance testing. In this paper, we review two complementary MMI techniques -- model selection and model averaging -- and highlight examples of their use by biogeographers. Model selection provides a means to simultaneously compare multiple models to evaluate how well each is supported by data, and potentially to identify the best supported model(s). When model selection indicates no clear `best' model, model averaging is useful to account for parameter uncertainty. Both techniques can be implemented in information-theoretic and Bayesian frameworks and we outline the debate about interpretations of the different approaches. We summarise recommendations for avoiding philosophical and methodological pitfalls, and suggest when each technique is best used. We advocate a pragmatic approach to MMI, one that emphasises the `thoughtful, science-based, a priori' modelling that others have argued is vital to ensure valid scientific inference.},
