\opening{Dear Editor,}
Thanks for your editorial support with this article.
We have provided answers to all comments from the reviewers and prepared a new version of the article clarifying terminology, expanding a set of equations, and making connections to other approaches. In particular, we provide now equations that are equivalent to inverse-variance weighting methods as suggested by reviewer 1. 

You can find point-by-point answers to all reviewers' comments below. These are the same answers that were already provided in the discussion forum.
