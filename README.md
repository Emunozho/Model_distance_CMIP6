# Supplementary data, code, and text for the article "An information-theoretic approach to obtain ensemble averages from Earth system models" by C. Sierra and E. Mu√±oz
This repository contains code and data to reproduce all results from this publication. 
In particular, it contains NetCDF files with model weights needed for computing ensamble averages of NEP and NBP for a set of models participating in CMIP6.
These model weights can be found in the folder `data`. The file `nepCMIP6_ob_X-BASE.nc` contains model weights for the variable NEP, and the file `nbpCMIP6_ob_CarboScope.nc` contains model weights for the variable NBP. NetCDF files with sum of residuals between models and observational products, obtained with equation 17 from the publication, are also provided in this foler. 

Due to their large size, the source data from the CMIP6 models are not available in this repository, but they are openly available at https://cmip-data-pool.dkrz.de or at https://esgf-node.ipsl.upmc.fr/projects/cmip6-ipsl
